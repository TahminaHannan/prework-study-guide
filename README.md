# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for all Skills Bootcamp Front-End Web Development students who want to kick start this programme and prep themselves before the live class begin. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Due to the fast-paced nature of the bootcamp, completing the prework is essential to your success because it enables you to start the course warmed up and well-prepared. Completing the prework means that on Day 1 of the bootcamp, you will already have some coding experience, a simple website that you created, and a developers mindset.
